Things to do:
- Create model to predict 3 genres from lyrics text.
- Create model to predict 3 sentiments from lyrics text
- Save the models as pickle files

Dataset to use:
- mateibejan/multilingual-lyrics-for-genre-classification from Kaggle (has around 10 genres)

Dataset that could be used in the future for emotion classification:
- carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information (weights at least 6 GB)
Remark: can't use this dataset for genre classification because it contains only 5 genres
