                1. **Song so far:**  
                {current_chunks}

                2. **Genre:**  
                {genre}

                3. **Emotion:**  
                {emotion}

                **Guidelines:**  
                - Maintain the same lyrical style and structure as the song so far.  
                - Ensure the new stanza fits seamlessly with the existing lyrics.  
                - Reflect the chosen emotion in the words, tone, and imagery.  
                - Keep the genreâ€™s common themes and vocabulary in mind.  
                - Use poetic and evocative language appropriate for the mood.

                Now generate the stanza. Return ONLY the stanza itself, no more text:""",
